# Scorpy
Current Version 4.0
Using a raspberry pi, python and pygame, I use this code to generate a score overlay (green chroma-key) for sporting events (football). It displays a timer, titles and scores
Your video switcher will need to have chroma-key  to use it properly.

Screen size is set to 1920 x 1080, so output must be via the HDMI port.

NOTE: The Raspberry Pi doesn't actually do the chroma keying, it just generates a score/timer overlay for your vision mixer keyer.

(demo pix.jpg   ... With just 39 seconds to go, neither team has yet to score.)
