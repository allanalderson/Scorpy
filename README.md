# Scorpy
Using a raspberry pi, python and pygame, I use this code to generate a score overlay (green chroma-key) for sporting events (football). It displays a timer, titles and scores
Your video switcher will need to have chroma-key  to use it properly.

Screen size is set to 1920 x 1080, so output must be via the HDMI port.
