# Scorpy

Using a raspberry pi, python and pygame, I use this code to generate a score overlay (green chroma-key) for sporting events (football). It displays a timer, titles and scores and user images.

NOTE: The Raspberry Pi doesn't actually do the keying, it just generates a score/timer overlay for your vision mixer's keyer.

(demo pix.jpg   ... With just 39 seconds to go, neither team has yet to score.)

Keyboard operation:
tab = enter the team-names and set timer/clock (tab again to exit)
spacebar = On-air / Off-air toggle
t = Titles.
h = Halftime Score.
f = Fulltime Score.
r = Replay logo.
c = Clock (show/hide).
v = Variation.
b = Bars.
1~9 User images (e.g:  1.jpg @ 1920x1080).
